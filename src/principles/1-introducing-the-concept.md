      <li>Most boilers in the UK are set above this, with the average temperature of water to radiators being around 70 degrees.</li>

      <li>When combi boiler's flow temperature is set to under 55 degrees they will be condensing. This allows for the boilers to run more efficiently.</li>

      <ul>

      <li>Boiler flow temperature is the temperature that your boiler supplies water to the radiators. </li>

      <li>It is the temperature that your water is heated to by the boiler, as it travels around your system it cools down. </li>

      <li>It does not affect the water coming from your taps or showers. </li>

      <li>It is separate from the temperature on your thermostat, thermostat temperature is the air temperature in your room. Not the temperature of the radiators. </li>

      <li>Only when the water returning to the boiler is below 55 degrees will boilers be condensing and begin to reach their optimum efficiency.</li>

      <li>This could equate to up to £155 a year when the price cap increases in October. </li>

      <li>If half of UK homes reduced their flow temperature so that their boilers were condensing it would result in a 1% reduction in household carbon emissions.</li>

      <li>You can continue to change the setting to find the right balance between heat and energy/money saving.</li>

      <li>It can easily be reverted to a higher temperature or one the previous flow temperature setting. </li>

      <li>You can change this during the year is necessary, turning the flow temperatures up during the coldest periods. Just remember to reduce the flow temperature again afterwards.</li>

## What is it?

Users will often not be familiar with the concept of flow temperature, but by understanding some basics they will be more likely to proceed. When offering advice you should start by:

* concisely explaining the technical reason for lowering the flow temperature
* explaining the financial and environmental benefits
* reassuring users that their comfort will not be affected

You may wish to emphasise these differently depending on the audience. Suggestions for different messaging for different user groups can be found below.



## Why do it?

Our work has found that households often receive conflicting advice on the best way to heat their home, and lack the confidence to make changes themselves. The advice to lower boiler temperature can often seem counterintuitive as so we need to explain early on that it will not lead to lower home temperatures overall.

By being transparent about the reasons behind this action we can build more confidence in making the change. Doing this early on in the process also builds users’ confidence in changing wider heating habits. This will ultimately help to ensure that comfort isn’t affected as a result of lowering flow temperatures.
