    details: Boiler engineers are a trusted voice, they are a powerful way of
      distributing this advice. They should feel confident in talking to low
      flow temperatures. If discussin this in person boiler engineers
      should point households to other trusted sources.

## What is it?

Users will often not be familiar with the concept of flow temperature, but by understanding some basics they will be more likely to proceed. When offering advice you should start by;

- concisely explaining the technical reason for lowering the flow temperature
- explaining the financial and environmental benefits
- reassuring users that their comfort will not be affected

You may wish to emphasise these differently depending on the audience. Suggestions for different messaging for different user groups can be found below.

## Why do it?

Our work has found that households often receive conflicting advice on the best way to heat their home, and lack the confidence to make changes themselves. The advice to lower boiler temperature can often seem counterintuitive as so we need to explain early on that it will not lead to lower home temperatures overall.

By being transparent about the reasons behind this action we can build more confidence in making the change. Doing this early on in the process also builds users’ confidence in changing wider heating habits. This will ultimately help to ensure that comfort isn’t affected as a result of lowering flow temperatures.
