# What is it?

Users wish to have clear, relevant and approachable guidance on how to reduce their flow temperature. If the flow temperature is being reduced on their behalf how to make further changes should still be communicated. Users will also need to be aware of the changes that are to be expected from their heating after reducing their flow temperature. To do this successfully we have found the following steps are important;Â 

* Understand what boiler controls users have
* Give confidence in finding the right controls
* Provide clear guidance on what to change
* Re-assure users that changes to their heating are to be expected.



# Why do it ?

Breaking down the guidance so that is relevant helps to build trust with users, it will also ensure that the advice is relevant to the particular set up. Our research has found that specific guidance builds confidence, and that users felt confident in making future changes if the initial instructions were clear.

Ensuring that households are aware of the changes to their heating system will give reassurance to households that the heating is functioning correctly. It will help to prevent complaints or call outs to heat engineers or advice givers.
