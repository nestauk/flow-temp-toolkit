  - title: Identify what heating controls the household uses
    description: >+
      In order to give relevant advice on how to optimise the rest of the
      heating system, first collect details on what controls are in the user’s
      home. 

    body: >-
      <ul>

      <li>Ask what controls are in the user’s home.</li>

      <li>Specifically ask if homes have thermostatic radiator valves, a programmable timer or a thermostat.</li>

      <li>If giving guidance remotely, use imagery or descriptions as some users may not be sure what controls they have in the home. </li>

  - title: Provide guidance - thermostat / programmable timer
    description: "Specific guidance as to how households may want to adjust their
      thermostats and programmable timers. "
    body: >-
      <ul>

      <li>Identify whether the household uses a thermostat or programmable thermostat and timer. </li>

      <li> It may also be beneficial to explain the reasoning behind making changes to their thermostat or timer. </li>

      <li>Suggest that households may want to:

      <ul>

      <li>Extend the period of time that their home is heated for. For example, if their heating switches off at night, they should try setting the heating to come on a little earlier than usual.<br>

      <br>

      It may also be beneficial to explain some of the reasoning behind this, for example - “By slightly extending the period of time that your heating is on for you are allowing for a more gradual warm-up time. As your boiler should now be running more efficiently it should not increase your bills.”</li>

      <li>If a programmable timer or thermostat is used to set a nighttime and daytime temperature, the gap between the daytime and nighttime temperature may need to be reduced. For example, the nighttime temperature may need to be increased by 1 degree. The same principle could be used when people are out of the house during the day.

      <br>

      <br>

      It may also be beneficial to explain some of the reasoning behind this, for example, - “By reducing the gap between the night time and the day time temperature you are ensuring that the boiler doesn't have to work too hard to reach a comfortable temperature in the morning. This will help it maintain its efficiency. ”</li>

      </ul>

      </li>

      </ul>
  - title: Provide guidance - thermostatic radiator valves
    description: "Specific guidance as to how households may want to adjust their TRVs. "
    body: >-
      <ul>

      <li>If the home has TRVs fitted you could recommend that:

      <ul>

      <li>Households could fine-tune the temperature of individual rooms with their radiator valves. As the flow temperature is lower it may be best to heat all the rooms in a home evenly, so it may be beneficial to open all of the radiator valves. If some rooms are feeling a little colder, users could turn up the radiator valve in that room. If other rooms are too warm, they could turn it down.

      </li>

      <li>It may also be beneficial to explain some of the reasoning behind this, for example, “Opening these radiator valves will ensure that your radiators remain on until a comfortable temperature has been reached. It should also ensure that your boiler is running as efficiently as possible, as the water returning to your boiler will be cooler.”</li>

      </ul>

      </li>

      </ul>

## What's required?

Additional changes to the way users heat their homes may be needed alongside the reduction of flow temperatures. This step is about providing guidance to households on how best to heat their home, specific to the type of controls that they may have. In order for this to be successful, we have tried and tested three steps: 

* ask for information on the types of heating controls in the home
* give specific advice on how best to use these controls
* provide an explanation as to why these changes should be made. 

Any guidance should aim to ensure that users feel comfortable making further changes if necessary in order to maintain comfort.



## Why do it?

Our research revealed that users often find heating controls such as thermostats confusing and difficult to use. They also tend to be weary of over-generalised advice. Ensuring that the advice is clear and tailored to the specific circumstances of their homes and their controls can help overcome this.

There may be concerns that advising people to lower their boiler’s flow temperature will increase in complaints or callouts to heating engineers. This can be mitigated by ensuring that the heating system and controls are set up to work as efficiently as possible at lower flow temperatures, while also maintaining the level of comfort that householders prefer.
