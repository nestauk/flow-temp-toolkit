      <li>If the household uses a thermostat or programmable thermostat & timer. </li>

      <li> It may also be beneficial to explain the reasoning behind these changes.</li>

      <li>Suggest that households may want to;<ul>

      <li>Extend the period of time that their home is heated for. For example, if their heating switches off at night, try setting the heating to come on a little earlier than usual.<br>

      <br>

      An example reasoning being - “By slightly extending the period of time that your heating is on for you are allowing for a more gradual warm-up time. As your boiler should now be running more efficiently it should not increase your bills.”</li>

      <li>That if the home takes too long to warm up in the morning, try reducing the gap between the daytime and night-time temperature on the thermostat. For example, set it only 2 or 3 degrees lower at night than the day temperature. The same principle could be used when you’re out of the house for the day.<br>

      <br>

      An example reasoning being - “Opening these radiator valves will ensure that your radiators remain on until a comfortable temperature has been reached. It should also ensure that your boiler is running as efficiently as possible, as the water returning to your boiler will be cooler.”</li>

      <li>If the home has TRV’s fitted you could recommend that homes;

      <ul>

      <li>Households could fine-tune the temperature of individual rooms with their radiator valves. As the flow temperature is lower it may be best to heat all the rooms in a home evenly, so it may be beneficial to open all of the radiator valves. If some rooms are feeling a little colder, users could turn up the radiator valve in that room. If other rooms are too warm, they can turn it down.</li>

      <li>It may also be beneficial to explain some of the reasoning behind this, for example. “Opening these radiator valves will ensure that your radiators remain on until a comfortable temperature has been reached. It should also ensure that your boiler is running as efficiently as possible, as the water returning to your boiler will be cooler.”</li>

## What is required?

The way in which homes are heated may have to alter alongside the reduction of flow temperatures. This step provides guidance to households on how best to heat their home, specific to the type of controls that they may have. In order for this to be successful we have tried and tested three steps;

- Collect information on the types of heating controls in the home
- Give specific advice on how best to use these controls
- Provide an explanation as to why these changes should be made

Any guidance should aim to ensure that users feel comfortable making further changes as and when necessary in order to maintain comfort.

## Why do it?

Through our research, we heard that households were often confused about the best way to use the heating controls in their home, sometimes not fully understanding how they interact with each other. They were also confused and weary by over-generalised advice. Ensuring that the advice is as specific, relevant and directly relatable to the controls in user's homes will overcome this.

There are understandable concerns that by instructing homes to lower their flow temperatures there may be an increase in complaints to advice givers, or callouts to heating engineers. By ensuring that the rest of the heating is set up to work as efficiently as possible at lower flow temperatures, whilst also maintaining the level of comfort that homes are used to, these call-backs or complaints should be minimised.
