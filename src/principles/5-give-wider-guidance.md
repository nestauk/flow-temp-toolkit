## What is it?

This principle focuses on collecting information about the heating controls that users have in their homes before providing specific and relevant guidance to ensure that the whole heating system is working as efficiently as possibly at low temperatures.

## Why do it?

There are understandable reservations about lowering boiler flow temperatures, it is perceived that it will negatively effect comfort and may lead to more complaints for those who work in heating. By providing guidance about how to most efficiently heat homes, tailored to the controls that people have in their homes reduces the risks of complaints and increases household comfort.
