## What is it?

The way in which homes are heated may have to alter alongside the reduction of flow temperatures. This step provides guidance to households on how best to heat their home, specific to the type of controls that they may have. In order for this to be successful we have tried and tested three steps; 

* Collect information on the types of heating controls in the home
* Give specific advice on how best to use these controls
* Provide an explanation as to why these changes should be made 

Any guidance should aim to ensure that users feel comfortable making further changes as and when necessary in order to maintain comfort. 



## Why do it?

Through our research we heard that households were often confused about the best way to use the heating controls in their home, sometimes not fully understanding how they interact with each other. They were also confused and weary by over generalised advice. Ensuring that the advice is as specific, relevant and directly relatable to the controls in users homes will overcome this. 

There are understandable concerns that by instructing homes to lower their flow temperatures there may be an increase in complaints to advice givers, or call outs to heating engineers. By ensuring that the rest of the heating is set up to work  as efficiently as possible at lower flow temperatures, whilst also maintaining the level of comfort that homes are used to, these call-backs or complaints should be minimised.
