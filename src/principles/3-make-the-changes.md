    title: Define the type of boiler controls
    description: Check what type of controls the households boiler has
    body: >
      <ul>
        <li>
          Ensure boiler controls are accessible and visible and open any covering
          panel.
        </li>
        <li>
          Define what kind of controls the boiler has, we’ve found that there are
          three main types and offering these three options caters for the majority of
          needs.
          <ul>
            <li>
              Button-based boiler - a boiler with no dials on the control panel, only
              buttons.
            </li>
            <li>
              Single dial boiler - a boiler with a single dial, it may also have some
              buttons.
            </li>
            <li>
              Multiple dial boiler - a boiler with two dials, and maybe some buttons.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
          If guidance is being given remotely ensure that the above options are
          described and if possible illustrated to consumers.
        </li>

        <li>Use buttons that signify a change of value to reduce the flow temperature they could be represented as directional arrows or plus and minus symbols.</li>
        <li>Instruct to to 55°C or desired temperature.</li>
        <li>Suggest that users may have to press the &#039;OK&#039; or radiator button again to confirm the change</li>
        <li>(OPTIONAL) Give clarification on why the boiler should be set to 55 degrees.</li>
        <li>(OPTIONAL) Direct to further guidance incase users are struggling to change their flow temperature. One option is to direct users to freeboilermanuals.com and guide them to enter their boilers GC number. Every boiler has a GC number, and it&#039;s usually on the front of the boiler. It starts with &#039;GC&#039; followed by a 7 digit number.</li>

# What is it?

Users wish to have clear, relevant and approachable guidance on how to reduce their flow temperature. If the flow temperature is being reduced on their behalf how to make further changes should still be communicated. Users will also need to be aware of the changes that are to be expected from their heating after reducing their flow temperature. To do this successfully we have found the following steps are important;

- Understand what boiler controls users have
- Give confidence in finding the right controls
- Provide clear guidance on what to change
- Re-assure users that changes to their heating are to be expected.

# Why do it ?

Breaking down the guidance so that is relevant helps to build trust with users, it will also ensure that the advice is relevant to the particular set up. Our research has found that specific guidance builds confidence, and that users felt confident in making future changes if the initial instructions were clear.

Ensuring that households are aware of the changes to their heating system will give reassurance to households that the heating is functioning correctly. It will help to prevent complaints or call outs to heat engineers or advice givers.
