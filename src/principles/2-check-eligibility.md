    description: >-
      This guide focuses on gas condensing combination boilers, it’s important
      that clear questions are asked of households so that they are confident in
      identifying the type of boiler they have.

      <BR>

      - Check that users have a gas boiler.<BR>

      - Check that there is no hot water tank.<BR>

      - Give help and guidance on identifying what a water tank is, this could be a description or example image.<BR>

      - OPTIONAL - Check for possible vulnerabilities in the household (see subsection below)<BR>

    heading: Users who require a higher than average heating demand
    details: >
      If a member of a household requires higher than average indoor
      temperatures caution should be when providing guidance around low flow
      temperatures.


      Judgement should be made on how well the fabric of the building is suited to ensuring any low flow temperature system could match the required heat demand.

    heading: Those who may be limiting their energy use
    details: >-
      Caution should be given when presenting this advice to those that only use
      their heating for short intensive periods. Those rationing energy may
      ration lower flow temperature heating in a similar way, this may be
      counterproductive and reduce the level of comfort further. 


      A wider behaviour shift may be required to ensure they remain comfortable, this may not be a suitable ask of this user group.

    heading: Those users who may live with limited dexterity
    details: >-
      Users with dexterity issues may struggle to change settings on the
      boiler. 


      In order to ensure that these users are able to benefit from low flow temperatures it may be best to offer in person advice or ensure that any change to the boiler settings are made by a visiting professional, friend or relative. 


      It may also be worth ensuring that if needed the user has a support network to tweak settings after the flow temperature has been reduced.

## What is it?

In order to be confident that this advice is suitable and safe for a particular house, there needs to be confidence in the elements that make up the heating system. There are three main parts to this step;

- check that the house has a gas condensing combi boiler
- check that there is no hot water tank
- assess any vulnerabilities within the household

Users will need detailed guidance to ensure that their heating system is suitable as there is a low level of awareness of technical terms and of how the constituent parts of a system relate.

### Why do it?

Households want clear, specific advice. Ensuring that anyone who isn’t eligible for this advice is made aware as soon as possible removes this frustration and those users that do go through these questions are also given confidence that this advice is relevant.

There is established best practice around the storage and supply of hot water to taps and outlets in the home, this is to reduce the risk of legionnaires disease. By ensuring that this advice is only given to homes with a condensing combi boiler and no hot water tank we are reducing the risk of user error resulting in this best practice not being followed.

There is also extra guidance provided on checks you may want to consider if you are working with vulnerable users.
