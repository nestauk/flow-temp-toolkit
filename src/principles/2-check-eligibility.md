           If a household has certain health or wellbeing requirements this guidance may not be suitable for them. 

          - If there is a demand for high temperatures in the home this guidance may not be suitable, judgement should be made on how well the fabric of the building is suited to ensuring any low flow temperature system could provide the required heat. 


          - Those with dexterity issues may struggle to change settings on the boiler. 


          - Those rationing energy may ration lower flow temperature heating ina similar way, this may be counterproductive and reduce the level of comfort further.

## What is it?

Checks to ensure that this advice is relevant and safe to provide to people. This advice is only relevant for homes with a condensing combi boiler, that don’t have a hot water tank. You may also want to check for any vulnerability that may cause this advice to not be suitable. Our steps ensure that only suitable households are presented with advice.

### Why do it?

Households can be uncertain about the different components of their heating system, it is important to guide them through identifying their eligibility in order to ensure that the guidance results in savings and to remove any risk or dangers associated with legionnaires disease in hot water tanks. Vulnerable households should also be considered in screening, in order to only present this guidance to homes that are able to safely adapt to slightly longer heat up times.
