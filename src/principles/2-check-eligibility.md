## What is it?

Checks to ensure that this advice is relevant and safe to provide to people. This advice is only relevant for homes with a condensing combi boiler, that don’t have a hot water tank. You may also want to check for any vulnerability that may cause this advice to not be suitable. Our steps ensure that only suitable households are presented with advice.

### Why do it?

Households can be uncertain about the different components of their heating system, it is important to guide them through identifying their eligibility in order to ensure that the guidance results in savings and to remove any risk or dangers associated with legionnaires disease in hot water tanks. Vulnerable households should also be considered in screening, in order to only present this guidance to homes that are able to safely adapt to slightly longer heat up times.
