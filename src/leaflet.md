Nesta has produced a leaflet to communicate the points outlined in this toolkit in both English and Welsh. 

The guide has been produced to give a concise set of instructions that can be left with households. We’re actively looking for organisations to test this advice, if you are interested in working with us, please get in touch using the link at the top of the page.

Our leaflet is free to download and distribute.
