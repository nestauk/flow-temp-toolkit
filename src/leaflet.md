Users will often not be familiar with the concept of flow temperature, but by understanding some basics they will be more likely to proceed. When offering advice you should start by:

* concisely explaining the technical reason for lowering the flow temperature
* explaining the financial and envirionmental benefits
* reassuring users that their comfort will not be affected

You may wish to emphasise these differently depending on the audience. Suggestions for different messaging for different user groups can be found below.
