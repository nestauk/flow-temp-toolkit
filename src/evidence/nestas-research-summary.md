overview: >-
  Nesta has commissioned or undertaken a number of streams of work, they
  include:

  <ul>

  <li>Reviewing existing evidence on the impact of reducing flow temperatures. This work was carried out by Salford University.</li>

  <li>Measuring the impact of lowering flow temperatures in the [Energy House](https://energyhouse2.salford.ac.uk/energy-house-labs/energy-house/) at Salford University. The Energy House is a testing lab, including a traditional early twentieth century two bedroom terraced house, set up in an environmental chamber.</li>

  <li>Estimating the proportion of UK homes that could successfully lower flow temperatures, based on modelling work by Cambridge Architectural Research.</li>

  <li> Modelling the savings and impact on room temperatures as a result of changing flow temperatures, in a range of different housing types with occupants and heating preferences. This work was carried out by Energy Systems Catapult.</li>

  <li>Running a trial to test the effectiveness of our online tool for lowering flow temperatures with customers of the energy saving app Loop. This work was carried out by Nesta and the Behavioural Insights Team, in partnership with Loop.</li>

  </ul>


  All these reports can be found on Nesta’s website at \[insert link]. There is still room to learn more, and we are continuing to do further research.
takeaways: >-
  <ul>

  <li>Homes that currently have their boiler flow temperatures set to 80°C could reduce gas consumption for space heating by 12% by setting their flow temperature to 60°C, or by 16% by turning down to 55°C. </li>


  <li>Based on the 9% saving on total gas use from reducing flow temperatures from 80°C to 60°C (reported above), we estimate that a medium-sized household with an annual gas consumption of 12,000 kWh would save 1,092 kWh of gas per year. At a price of 10.3p per kWh of gas (the Energy Price Guarantee unit rate for gas), this equates to £112 per year.</li>
