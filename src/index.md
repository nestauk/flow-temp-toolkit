  <h1>Created by Nesta</h1>

  <p>This toolkit has been created by Nesta, the UK's innovation agency for social good</p>

  <p>Nesta’s <a href="https://www.nesta.org.uk/sustainable-future/" target="_blank"> sustainable future mission</a> aim is to accelerate the decarbonisation of household activities in the UK and improve levels of productivity. Our goal is that, by 2030, the UK will have reduced household carbon emissions by 28 per cent from 2019 levels, and will be on track to reach zero by 2048.</p>

  <p>Our focus on low flow temperatures is part of our sustainable future mission’s aim to optimise current heating systems, with the goal of reducing emissions.</p>

# Why we're here

Households could be saving energy and gas by ensuring that their boilers are running as efficiently as possible. Many condensing combi boilers are generating more emissions and costing households more than they need to.

If these boilers were optimised, households could reduce their energy use, emissions and costs.

This toolkit is a resource for people giving advice in the energy and home heating sector. It contains guidance, ready-to-use materials and best practice examples of how to ensure boilers are running efficiently while maintaining comfort and mitigating vulnerabilities.
