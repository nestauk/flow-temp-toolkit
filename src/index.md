## Why we're here

Almost every condensing combi boiler in the UK is burning more gas, generating more emissions and costing households more than they need to.

If these boilers were optimised, households could reduce their energy use, emissions and costs.

The ‘Flow temperature toolkit” is a resource for those giving advice in the energy and home heating sector. It contains guidance, ready to use assets and best practice examples of how to ensure boilers are running efficiently whilst maintaining comfort and mitigating vulnerabilities.
