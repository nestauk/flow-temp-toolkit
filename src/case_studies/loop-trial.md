title: Nesta X Loop
tagline: An email campaign and online walkthrough to guide users through
  reducing flow temperatures
description: >
  Nesta and Loop ran an email campaign in April 2022, contacting Loop customers
  and prompting them to reduce their flow temperature.


  The email campaign provided a link to an online walkthrough, similar to the white label version available here, information around why flow temperatures are important and linked to a more in depth blog. You can view the loop blog here.


  The primary focus of this test was to test the customer journey of providing instruction on how to lower flow temperature through an online walkthrough.
