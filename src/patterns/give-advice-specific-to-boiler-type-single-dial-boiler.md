## **Key points to communicate**

* Ensure that users eligibility has been checked using the guidelines in “4.2 checking eligibility” 
* Illustrate what the radiator symbol may look like.
* Flow temperature can be mistaken for hot water temperature, hot water being the water that is supplied to the taps and showers. Ensure that the above instructions are understood.
* **If the radiator symbol is next to a button suggest pressing this button to select flow temperature.**
* Check whether the boiler has a digitial display. \
