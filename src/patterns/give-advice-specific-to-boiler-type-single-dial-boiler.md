## **Key points to communicate**

* Ensure that users eligibility has been checked using the guidelines in “4.2 checking eligibility” 
* Illustrate what the radiator symbol may look like. 
* Flow temperature can be mistaken for hot water temperature, hot water being the water that is supplied to the taps and showers. Ensure that the above instructions are understood.
* If the radiator symbol is next to a button suggest pressing this button to select flow temperature. 
* Check whether the boiler has a digital display. 
* * If it does suggest turning the dial until 55 degrees is displayed. Reassure the user that even if this number changes after the dial has been left, the maximum flow temperature should have been set correctly.
  * If the boiler doesn't have a digital display give guidance on the approximate position to adjust the dial to. We have provided suggested graphics below, although the exact position will depend on the make and model of the boiler. 
* (OPTIONAL) Give clarification on why the boiler should be set to 55 degrees.
* (OPTIONAL) Direct to further guidance incase users are struggling to change their flow temperature. One option is to direct users to freeboilermanuals.com and guide them to enter their boilers GC number. Every boiler has a GC number, and it's usually on the front of the boiler. It starts with 'GC' followed by a 7 digit number.
