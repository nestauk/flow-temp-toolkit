  differently when changing flow temperature. This will help to give confidence

## Key points to communicate

* Communicate that their heating system will act differently because of the change. 
* Stress that these changes are to be expected and a good way to confirm that the change has been made correctly. 
* Suggest that radiators will be cooler to the touch. 
* Suggest that households may notice a reduction in your gas bill. 
* Suggest that it may take slightly longer for homes to heat up. 
* We would recommend adding more information around these points to address concerns and re-assure users that their homes should still be comfortable.
* It is crucial to direct households to our last principle, where we recommend further changes to the heating system in order to maintain comfort.
