## Key points to communicate

* Boiler flow temperature is the temperature that your boiler supplies water to the radiators. 
* It does not affect the water coming from your taps or showers. 
* It is separate from the temperature on your thermostat, thermostat temperature is the air temperature in your room. Not the temperature of the radiators.
