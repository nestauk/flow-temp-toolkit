## Key points to communicate

* Boiler flow temperature is the temperature that your boiler supplies water to the radiators. 
* It is the temperature that your water is heated to by the boiler, as it travels around your system it cools down.
* It does not affect the water coming from your taps or showers. 
* It is separate from the temperature on your thermostat, thermostat temperature is the air temperature in your room. Not the temperature of the radiators.
* Only when the water returning to the boiler is below 55 degrees will boilers be condensing and begin to reach their optimum efficiency.
