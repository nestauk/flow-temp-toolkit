## Key points to communicate

* Illustrate what the radiator symbol may look like. 
* Ensure users find the button that corresponds to the radiator symbol. 
* Select the radiator flow temperature. Press the button that has the radiator symbol on or near to it. The display should then change to show the current flow temperature. 
* Use buttons that signify a change of value to reduce the flow temperature they could be represented as directional arrows or plus and minus symbols.
* Instruct to to 55°C or desired temperature.
* Suggest that users may have to press the 'OK' or radiator button again to confirm the change.
* (OPTIONAL) Give clarification on why the boiler should be set to 55 degrees.
* (OPTIONAL) Direct to further guidance incase users are struggling to change their flow temperature. One option is to direct users to freeboilermanuals.com and guide them to enter their boilers GC number. Every boiler has a GC number, and it's usually on the front of the boiler. It starts with 'GC' followed by a 7 digit number.
