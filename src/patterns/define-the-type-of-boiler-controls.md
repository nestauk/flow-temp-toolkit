**Key points to communicate**

* Ensure the user is in front of their boiler. 
* Ask what kind of controls the boiler has, we’ve found that there are three main types and offering these three options caters for the majority of needs. 
* * Button-based boiler - a boiler with no dials on the control panel, only buttons
  * Single dial boiler - a boiler with a single dial, it may also have some buttons.
  * Multiple dial boiler - a boiler with two dials, and maybe some buttons. 
* Ensure that the above options are described and if possible illustrated to consumers.
