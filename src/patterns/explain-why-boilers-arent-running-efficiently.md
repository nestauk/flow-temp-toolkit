title: Explain why boilers arent running efficiently
tagline: A common misconception is that combination boilers are already very
  efficient and that there is nothing a household can do to improve this. It’s
  important to explain why this may not be true.

## Key points to communicate

* Combi boilers work best when they heat radiators at 55°C or below.
* Most boilers in the UK are set above this, with the average temperature of water to radiators being around 70 degrees.
* When combi boilers flow temperature is set to under 55 degrees they will be condensing. This allows for the boilers to run more efficiently.
* Households could cut their gas use by 6-8% by ensuring that their boilers are condensing.
* The lower you set your flow temperature the more efficient your boiler will be, find the right balance.
* Stress that this is a change to the boiler, not the thermostat.
